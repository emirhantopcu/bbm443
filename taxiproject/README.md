I used seconds when checking time, block.timestamp function takes the current time as seconds. 
I looked for the difference between second values when calculating passed time.
15552000 seconds are equal to 6 months and 2592000 seconds are equal to 1 month.

I used compiler version 0.8.7 on Remix.
